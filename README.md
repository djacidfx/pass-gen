Create strong passwords as many and as long as you want.

In this project, there is a file called pass_generate.py, which you can use to generate as many passwords as you want. After generating passwords, it stores them in a file. Be sure to remember to rename the previously created file before creating a new password so that new passwords are not overwritten.

In addition to the password generator file, there is another file called pass_to_hash.py that displays the entered password as a hash (sha256).

Sometimes the existence of a hashed password is used to compare and check the password or to record the password as a hash in the database.
